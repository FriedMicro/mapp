mapp
====

an experimental mod for minetest which adds maps


Written originally by 4aiman

Changes done by Sokomine:
* added diffrent resolutions
* resolution can be changed by right-clicking with the map
* Supported: 2x2, 4x4, 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128

DO.NOT.USE.ON.A.SERVER. This is serious! The higher the resolution,
the more problematic it gets. For me, it works to some degree up
to 64x64, but 128er resolution usually glitches horribly and takes
a long time to display. Play with it in your singleplayer world only!
